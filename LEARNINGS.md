## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

### What MCP Is

**MCP** is an open protocol (introduced by Anthropic, late 2024) that standardizes how LLM applications connect to external tools and data. Think of it as **USB-C for AI**: instead of every app writing custom glue code for every API, the API is wrapped once in an **MCP server**, and any **MCP client** (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, a Python script, PydanticAI) can plug in and use it.

The architecture is client–server:

```
LLM app (host)
    └── MCP client  ──(protocol: stdio or HTTP/SSE)──►  MCP server
                                                          ├── tools      (functions the model can call)
                                                          ├── resources  (data the model can read)
                                                          └── prompts    (reusable prompt templates)
```

- The **server** exposes capabilities — most commonly *tools*, but also *resources* and *prompts*.
- The **client** connects, asks the server what it offers (`list_tools()`), and relays those to the model. The model never talks to the server directly; the client brokers every call.
- The protocol itself is JSON-RPC over stdio (local servers) or HTTP/SSE (remote servers).

The key insight: MCP doesn't add new model capabilities — tool calling already existed. It standardizes the *plumbing*, so integrations are written once and work everywhere.

### Plain Tool vs MCP Tool

A **tool** (in the LLM sense) is a function the model can call — defined as a JSON schema, the model decides when to invoke it, you execute it and return the result. This is the raw pattern used in `patterns/workflows/3-tools.py`.

An **MCP tool** is the same concept but served over a standardized protocol:

| | Plain tool | MCP tool |
|---|---|---|
| Definition | JSON schema hardcoded in the client | Defined once in the server, auto-discovered by any client |
| Execution | Your client runs the function | The MCP server runs the function |
| Reuse | Copy-paste into every project | Any MCP-compatible client connects and uses it |
| Hosting | In-process with the client | Separate process, can be remote |

Plain tools are fine for one-off scripts. MCP tools are the right choice when you want capabilities reused across projects, teams, or clients.

### Benefits of MCP Tools

1. **Discoverability** — the model discovers available tools at runtime via `list_tools()`. The tool description *is* the documentation for the model; no human needs to read docs and hardcode schemas.
2. **Reusability** — define once in the server, use from any MCP-compatible client (Claude Code, Python client, PydanticAI, LangChain). No copy-pasting JSON schemas.
3. **Separation of concerns** — the server owns the implementation; the client owns the orchestration. Update tool logic without touching client code.
4. **Model-friendly output** — shape return values for LLM consumption (concise, no irrelevant fields) rather than for a frontend.
5. **Composability** — connect to multiple MCP servers and the model sees all tools in a flat list. Mix your own servers with external ones (e.g. DeepWiki) with no glue code.

### Why Companies Publish MCP Servers, Not Agents

Tools are **stateless** — call them, get a result, done. An agent has a loop, memory, and decision-making built in. Sharing a stateful agent is harder to host and forces your orchestration logic on the consumer.

When you expose `get_weather` as an MCP tool, any client can use it however they want — once, in a loop, in parallel, conditionally. If you wrapped it in an agent, you'd be dictating the prompt design, model choice, and loop logic to every client. Companies want to own that layer.

**A2A (Agent-to-Agent protocol)** is the emerging standard for sharing agents the way MCP shares tools. As it matures, expect agent marketplaces the same way MCP server directories exist today.

### When to Wrap Company APIs as MCP Tools

REST APIs are designed for **developers writing code**. MCP tools are designed for **models doing reasoning**. If your clients are building agentic systems, expose MCP tools — the model can discover and call them without any human writing glue code.

A company with APIs like `make_sentence_compliant` and `get_customer` should wrap them as MCP tools, not agents. The client's model decides when to call each tool. Group related tools into logical servers:

```
compliance_server  →  make_sentence_compliant, check_policy, flag_content
data_server        →  get_customer, get_contract, search_documents
```

### When to Use MCP

The deciding question is not "internal vs external" — it's **"is the caller an LLM or a programmer?"**

**Frontend → MCP tools? No.** MCP solves a problem frontends don't have: runtime discovery by a model. A frontend developer knows the endpoints at build time, so discovery buys nothing — and costs a lot:

- **Wrong output shape** — good MCP tools return concise, LLM-friendly text; a UI needs structured JSON with IDs, timestamps, pagination cursors, every field.
- **Lost HTTP semantics** — REST gives per-route caching, CDN, status codes, rate limiting, browser-native auth. MCP is JSON-RPC over a session; none of that applies cleanly.
- **Indirection tax** — tunneling typed API calls through a protocol designed for an intermediary (the model) that isn't there.

**Internal agents → MCP tools? Yes.** If internal agents or LLM apps (including Claude Code/Desktop used by the team) need a capability, MCP earns its keep even with zero external consumers: define once, every agent discovers it; the owning team controls the tool description and output shaping; updates propagate at the next `list_tools()`.

Exception: one LLM app calling one function → skip MCP, use an in-process plain tool (`3-tools.py` pattern).

**The pattern: don't choose.** Keep the service layer as the single source of truth and expose two thin doors into it:

```
frontend / mobile / partner devs ──► REST / GraphQL ──┐
                                                      ├──► service layer
internal & external agents ────────► MCP server ──────┘    (single source of truth)
```

The MCP server is a thin wrapper over the same functions the REST handlers call — it adds model-oriented descriptions and reshapes output for LLM consumption. Each consumer type gets an interface designed for it; business logic lives in one place.

### MCP vs A2A

| | MCP | A2A |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Connect agents to tools and data | Connect agents to other agents |
| **State** | Stateless (tools) | Stateful (tasks with lifecycle) |
| **Task lifecycle** | Fire and forget | submitted → working → completed / failed |
| **Streaming** | Not built in | Native SSE |
| **Maturity** | Production-ready | Emerging (2025) |

Use MCP for capabilities. Use A2A for orchestrating agents across teams or vendors.

## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

### What RAG Is

RAG grounds an LLM's answer in your own documents instead of relying on what the model memorized during training. Pipeline: **embed → vector search → (rerank) → generate**.

```
query ──► embed ──► vector DB (top-k by similarity) ──► [rerank] ──► LLM (context + query) ──► answer
```

The retrieval side ("R") finds relevant text; the generation side ("G") asks the LLM to answer using only that text. Implemented end-to-end in `agentic-rag/rfp-assistant-excel/`.

### Two-Stage Retrieval: Bi-encoder + Cross-encoder

| | Bi-encoder (retrieve) | Cross-encoder (rerank) |
|---|---|---|
| How it scores | Encodes query and document **separately**, compares vectors | Encodes query + document **together**, one forward pass |
| Speed | Fast — documents pre-embedded at ingest time | Slow — must run per query/candidate pair |
| Scale | Thousands of documents | Only the top-k candidates from stage 1 |
| Quality | Mediocre on subtle wording differences | Much higher — model sees both texts at once |

Stage 1 (bi-encoder + vector DB) provides **recall**: cheaply narrow thousands of documents to a handful of candidates. Stage 2 (cross-encoder) provides **precision**: re-score just those candidates accurately. Used together because the cross-encoder alone is too slow to run against a whole knowledge base.

### Confidence Gating

Don't always force-feed the LLM a context. Score the top reranked candidate(s) and only pass them as context if they clear a threshold; otherwise tell the user no good match was found rather than generating from a weak match. The threshold lives on the reranker's score scale (raw logits vs 0–1 sigmoid), so it must be re-tuned whenever the reranker model changes.

### Challenges with RAG

- **Retrieval quality is the bottleneck** — chunking, embedding model choice, and reranking determine whether the right context even reaches the LLM. Bad retrieval → bad answer, regardless of model quality.
- **Context dilution** — too many chunks in the prompt buries the relevant one ("lost in the middle") and increases cost/latency.
- **Staleness** — the vector index must be rebuilt as source documents change; it's a snapshot, not live data.
- **Evaluation is hard** — retrieval quality (did we find the right chunks) and generation quality (did the model use them well) need separate metrics and a labeled golden set.
- **No multi-step reasoning** — classic RAG is single-shot retrieve-then-generate; it can't decide "look up X, then based on that look up Y."
- **"Answer only from context" is an instruction, not a guarantee** — the LLM can still drift or hallucinate.

### RAG vs MCP — When to Use Which

These solve different problems and are commonly combined, not competing choices:

| | RAG | MCP / Tools |
|---|---|---|
| Best for | Unstructured knowledge (docs, past Q&A, policies) where semantic similarity is the only practical lookup | Structured or live data (databases, APIs, file systems) that can be queried precisely |
| How it answers | "Find text similar in meaning to the query" | "Run this exact function and get the exact result" |
| Freshness | Snapshot — index rebuilt periodically | Live — hits the source directly |
| Context size | Depends on chunking/reranking quality | Naturally small — fetch only what's needed for the query |

"Keep the context window small" is solved by **better retrieval** (smaller chunks, reranking, confidence gating), not by replacing RAG with tools — tools don't help when the knowledge is unstructured prose with no precise query. For an RFP assistant, the realistic pattern is both: MCP/tools for "look up this client's contract terms in the database," RAG for "find similar answers we've given to this kind of question before."

## Agent Patterns

### Agent vs Subagent

There is no technical distinction — it is purely about role in the system. The same code can be both.

- **Agent** = runs a loop, has autonomy, decides which tools to call
- **Subagent** = an agent being orchestrated by another agent

`MCPOpenAIClient` in this repo is an agent when run standalone. Wrap it in `agent_server.py` and have an orchestrator call it, and that same instance becomes a subagent. The label describes the relationship, not the code.

### MCP Tool vs Agent — When to Use Which

- **Capability** (do X to Y) → MCP tool
- **Workflow** (decide how to apply X, Y, Z to achieve a goal) → agent

If the decision-making and sequencing should belong to the *caller*, expose a tool. If you want to encapsulate the reasoning loop, expose an agent.

### Multi-Agent Pattern with MCP

An orchestrator can treat a sub-agent as just another MCP server:

```
orchestrator (MCPOpenAIClient)
    └── agent_server.py  (port 8052)  ← exposes ask_agent() tool
            └── MCPOpenAIClient internally
                    ├── kb_server   (port 8050)
                    └── weather_server (port 8051)
```

The orchestrator only knows `ask_agent` exists — it has no visibility into what tools the sub-agent uses. The `MCPOpenAIClient` class is the same at both levels; only the servers it connects to differ.

### Agent Loop Pattern

The standard agent loop (used in `MCPOpenAIClient.process_query`):

1. Call model with tools available
2. If model returns tool calls → execute them, append results to messages, go to 1
3. If model returns a final answer → return it
4. Safety cap: `max_turns` prevents infinite loops

## APIs and SDKs

### Chat Completions vs OpenAI Responses API

| | Chat Completions | Responses API |
|---|---|---|
| **Availability** | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral (standard) | OpenAI only |
| **State** | You manage the messages list | OpenAI stores history server-side |
| **Built-in tools** | Not available | `web_search`, `file_search`, `code_interpreter` |
| **MCP compatibility** | Yes — MCP tool format maps directly | No |
| **Portability** | Works across all providers | OpenAI-specific |

Use Chat Completions when building MCP-based or multi-provider systems. Use Responses API when you need OpenAI's built-in tools.

### Built-in Tools vs Custom Function Tools (Responses API)

- **Built-in tools** (`web_search`, etc.) — OpenAI executes them internally. You just declare them; no execution code needed. You only check `output_item.type == "web_search_call"` if you want to log it.
- **Custom function tools** — same as Chat Completions: model decides to call them, you execute and return the result.

### PydanticAI and LangChain Under the Hood

Both abstract over Chat Completions (or equivalent). PydanticAI auto-generates JSON tool schemas from function signatures and runs the agent loop for you — exactly what `MCPOpenAIClient` does manually. The difference is operational convenience, not capability. Understanding the raw pattern first (as in this repo) makes frameworks trivial to pick up.

### `async with` and Why It's Needed

```python
async with MCPOpenAIClient() as client:
    ...
```

This calls `__aenter__` on enter and `__aexit__` on exit (even if an exception is raised). In `MCPOpenAIClient`, `__aexit__` awaits `self.exit_stack.aclose()` to tear down all HTTP sessions — that requires `await`, which only works in an async context. A regular `with` can't do this.

`__aenter__` here just returns `self` (nothing async happens on entry). The `async with` is needed purely because of `__aexit__`. Some classes use `__aenter__` meaningfully — e.g. awaiting until a background task is ready — but that's not the case here.

## Frameworks

### Raw API vs Framework vs MCP

| | Raw API (`3-tools.py`) | Framework (`PydanticAI`) | MCP (`MCPOpenAIClient`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Schema definition | Hand-written JSON | Auto-generated from function signature | Defined in server, auto-discovered |
| Agent loop | Manual | Framework handles it | Manual (you built it) |
| Tool execution | Manual dispatch | Framework handles it | Manual dispatch |
| Portability | Provider-specific | Multi-provider | Multi-provider + multi-server |
| Best for | Learning, one-off scripts | Production agents | MCP-integrated systems |
